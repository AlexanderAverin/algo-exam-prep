What about a proff? Why can we just sort values, first push requsted vertex and then push all other vertices in ascending or descending order.

Let's try to push 34 to the tree. And then push values in descending order. The thing is that we will always (until we reach our goal) push new vertex on the right from 34. That's because right tree always gets filled up.

Lets say that in other words. Considering inorder traversal new value will be inserted between 34 and larger values.
